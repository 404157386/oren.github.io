## Description

Graph databases are the future. Many organizations adopted graph databases - IoT, health care, financial services, telecommunications and governments.
What are the reason for this trend? What are the use cases and what are the Open Source databases you should look into for your use case?
We'll dive into a few of them and equip the attendees with everything they need to start using a graph database.
This workshop is based on our research and implementation of a graph database at Sanguine, a medical starup from LA.
