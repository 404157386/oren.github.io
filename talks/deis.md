Description
-----------

I assume you are are part of a development team and you have mulitple projects in different technologies and languages.
You are using a PAAS provider like Heroku to make your life easier but a few things bothers you:

1. You are very limited in what you can do with your current PAAS.
2. You can't move easily to a new PAAS provider (lock-in issue).
2. The performance you get from each host is low.
3. You want to squeeze more out of every host you have.
4. You are paying thousands of dollars every month.

What can you do about it? Well, today there are a few interesting open source solutions for your private PAAS.
The most promising one is Deis. It's written in Golang, uses a few great open source components - Docker, CoreOS and Fleet and is already being used by many companies.

## Topics covered

* Brief history of containers and PAAS.
* The motivation behind the project.
* What can you do with Deis?
* Live demo of my Deis cluster.
* A pick behind the curtain (it contains 10 docker containers!).
* How to setup your own.
