# Hello World in Go - Remote pair programming party

We had an intereting discussion at the recent LA CTO Forum about the need to keep up with the recent technologies.
One member, Pradipe, mentioned that many job interviews focus on the hottest languages instead of the core principles of software engineering.
Hearing that I invited anyone interested to a remote programming party where I can share my love for the Go programming language.

Pradipe, Kuba, and Sean joined a google hangout session and also connected (ssh) to my server and we worked on the same codebase. Here is the video:
