Description

If you think web development is a jungle, wait until you'll dive into game development using web technologies.
There are a few advancements in recent years that made it possible to build a full stack games using JavaScript -
The maturity of Canvas, WebGL, web audio and video with the raise of Node.JS flatform with WebRTC and other 

Full-stack JavaScript application opens up new possibilities but it also adds a challenge of making many in-flight decisions, such as the following: Should we use a web framework? Which one? How to organize our client-side codebase? Should we write in Object Oriented or Functional style?

In this talk we won't spend time on fluff and dive right in to a real codebase.
I'll share code and practices that are applicable immediately to any JavaScript developer.

## Topics covered

* Web frameworks Fight! Express vs Hapi vs http.createServer
* Client side code - Browserify? Require.js? Bower?
* Code style - OO vs Functional
* Control Flow - Callbacks vs Promises vs Generators
* Tests - TDD? unit, integration, tape vs mocha
* Error handling

When asynchronous style finally makes sense:
