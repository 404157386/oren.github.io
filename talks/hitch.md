Description
-----------

YP.com is the largest Ruby shop in LA. We just finished migrating a large codebase from Ruby to Node.js.

Full-stack JavaScript application opens up new possibilities but it also adds a challenge of making many in-flight decisions, such as the following: Should we use a web framework? Which one? How to organize our client-side codebase? Should we write in Object Oriented or Functional style?

In this talk we won't spend time on fluff and dive right in to a real codebase.
I'll share code and practices that are applicable immediately to any JavaScript developer.

## Topics covered

* Web frameworks Fight! Express vs Hapi vs http.createServer
* Client side code - Browserify? Require.js? Bower?
* Code style - OO vs Functional
* Control Flow - Callbacks vs Promises vs Generators
* Tests - TDD? unit, integration, tape vs mocha
* Error handling

When asynchronous style finally makes sense:

When not collecting Hello Kitty accessories, Oren likes to create things and break them apart. He hacks on Node.js at YP.com and eats Javascript for breakfast.
