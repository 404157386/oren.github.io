**The Event**  
[The event](http://www.meetup.com/SoCal-Node-JS/events/222626246) was part of SoCal Node.js meetup group, organized by [David Aktary](https://twitter.com/davidaktary) and [Sandra Evling](http://www.meetup.com/SoCal-Node-JS/members/14551792). Thank you both for a great venue. Another fantastic talk was given by [Samuel Ishmael Philip](https://github.com/ishmaelthedestroyer). He showed us best practices of testing our API. It was a very practical session and I will apply his examples on my current codebase.

**The Talk**  
[David](https://twitter.com/davidguttman) gave as a glimps into the future of Javascript and Node.js - He showed us the recent work of a few Node.js mad scientists that push the boundaries of our field ([Slides]( http://masters-in-node.surge.sh)). I took picture of each slide and than I realized that a video is a better idea. I appologize on the not-so-great quality.
